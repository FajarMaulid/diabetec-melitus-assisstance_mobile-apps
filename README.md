Hereâ€™s a sample README file for a project using **React Native (Expo)** for the frontend and **Express.js** for the backend. This README will help you document the steps to set up and run both parts of the application.

# Welcome to the React Native Expo & Express App ðŸš€

This project uses **React Native with Expo** for the frontend, providing a seamless cross-platform mobile app experience, and **Express.js** for the backend, delivering a powerful and flexible server framework.

## Requirements

- **Node.js**: Version 14 or higher
- **npm**: Version 6 or higher
- **Python**: Version 3.6 or higher
- **pip**: Python package manager
- **Expo CLI**: Install using `npm install -g expo-cli`
- **Postman** (optional): For testing API endpoints

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Frontend Dependencies

To set up the mobile app, navigate to the `frontend` folder and install the required dependencies with npm.

```bash
cd bpjs_pepl
npm install
```

- **Explanation**: This installs all the necessary npm packages for your React Native app, as defined in `package.json`.

### 2. Install Backend Dependencies

For the backend, go to the `backend` folder and install the necessary npm dependencies:

```bash
cd simple_backend
npm install
```

- **Explanation**: This installs all the necessary Express.js packages and other dependencies for your backend API.

### 3. Run the Frontend

Start the React Native Expo frontend using the following command from the `frontend` directory:

```bash
cd bpjs_pepl
npx expo start
```
This will launch the Expo Developer Tools in your browser, typically running on `http://localhost:8081/`. You can run the app on an emulator or scan the QR code using the Expo Go app on your mobile device. 

### 4. Run the Backend

Start the backend server using the following command from the `backend` directory:

```bash
cd simple_backend
node index.js
```

- **Explanation**: This will start the Express server, typically running on `http://localhost:8000/` by default. You can adjust the port if needed in the `index.js` file.

- **Explanation**: This command will launch Expo Developer Tools in your browser. You can run the app on an emulator or scan the QR code using the Expo Go app on your mobile device.

## Additional Notes

### Backend API

The Express server is designed to provide API endpoints for the mobile app. Ensure your API is working correctly by testing it with a tool like Postman or by sending requests from your app.

You may need to add routes in `backend/routes` to handle various requests from the mobile app. For example:
```js
// Example of a simple Express route in backend/routes/api.js
app.get('/api/data', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'Hello from Express!' });
});
```
